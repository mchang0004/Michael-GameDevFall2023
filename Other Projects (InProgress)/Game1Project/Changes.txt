1.0.01a
- This contains basic inventory + hotbar
- Combat, Movement, and Enemies Scripts
- Functional Melee Weapon
- Basic Map Area
1.0.02a

1.0.03a
- Added New Floor Tileset
- Edited Basic Map Area
- Fixed Test Button for Taking Damage
- Allowed consuming using left click

1.0.04a
- Handled Full Inventory and Still Collecting Loot
   - Detects when inventory is full and when there is a stackable item that can still be filled
- IDK SOMETHING ELSE
1.0.05a
- Added code to loot to randomy delay to prevent 2 items from entering at the same time when 1 slot is available.
- Added Health UI
- Collectable Items will be Green for Bug Testing
1.0.06a
- Added new Item Types and organized the inventory to accept those new item types in specific equipment slots. (Started in 1.0.03a, but its now finished)
- Modified the collection to be faster to avoid items trailing behind the player when walking/running
- Added new Animator for TargetDummy/PotionDummy and TesterGoblin to allow to future enemy attacks.
- FIXED (Bug): When inventory is full and inventory UI is open, dragging an item out allows for new item to be picked up, causing the inventory to be full. Then releasing dragged item, causes said item to bind onto the recently added item. (Solution, disable pickup for items when dragging)
- FIXED (Bug): Swapping weapons does not change the attack point position to new position for weapon. (Solution, created new getLastDirection function in playerMovement and simplified existing code in player update).
1.0.07a (9/12/23) to (9/13/23)

_ FIXED (Bug) Lines inbetween tiles when moving in game. (Pixel Perfect Camera can fix some of these issues, however, it still persists) (Solution was tilesets sprites on wrong layer).
_ FIXED (Bug) When weapon swing ends, there is a chance that the sprite will flash at the reset position, instead of being hidden. Had to redo some logic in the swing class.
_ FIXED (Bug) Can tap corner directions to have player sprite face a different direction than the swinging direction. Solution was to use last direction for player sprite animator instead of direction.

BUGS:
_Lines between tiles due to package.
_The currently 'commented out' isChatting conditional interferes with attacking and movement, forcing it to always be on or off depending on the bool. When enabled, it makes it so you can attack when inventory is open & can move items when inventory is closed. (May need to rethink the chatting function)
